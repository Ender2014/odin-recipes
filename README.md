This project is a basic HTML site with basic HTML elements.

This is a testing ground for the knowledge I've accumulated so far for basic HTML. 

At the end of this project, I shuold have demonstrated the skill to create a basic boilerplate, use paragraphs, headers, lists, and other text highlighters. 

#Updated to include CSS.
