This project is a basic HTML site with basic HTML elements and CSS styling.

This is a testing ground for the knowledge I've accumulated so far for basic HTML and CSS. 

At the end of this project, I shuold have demonstrated the skill to create a basic boilerplate, use paragraphs, headers, lists, other text highlighters, and basic CSS styling.

#Updated to include CSS.
